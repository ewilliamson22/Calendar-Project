# How Do I Spend My Time in Quarantine?
## Tracking My Time for 10 Days in Google Calendar

###Questions of Interest
Before starting this project, I intended to answer the following questions: how does sleep affect my productivity the next day, how does the time spent between each of my classes differ, and how much time do I spend on my phone/watching TV versus other activities. I set out to answer these questions but also looked at different variations of them while analyzing my data.

I tracked my days in Google Calendar for 10 days. Here is an example of part of a day I tracked:

![Tuesday, April 14](./img/12.png)

Create a "img" folder within your calendar-project repo and store the image files there.

# Data collection

I collected data by . . . 

I can write a bulleted list like this:

- here's the first thing I want to say
- and I also want to say this
- lastly, this

And a numbered list like this:

1. First thing
2. Second thing
3. Third thing

# Results

And here are my results . . .

```{r}
# intersperse relevant figures and text
```
